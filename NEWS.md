# ggtaichi 0.3.0

This release closes the structural gap in the design and brings the package up
to date with ggplot2 4.x. A taichi grid is a *superposition* comparison: it
shows two sources in one position, which is what makes spatial patterns
directly comparable, and which is also why it can say "which is bigger here?"
but not "by how much?". 0.3.0 answers the second question three ways (as a
third channel of the glyph, as a companion heatmap, and as a table) and
adds the two things a colour-encoded chart needs to be trustworthy: an
interactive route to the exact values, and a way to check that its two colour
ramps are a fair pair.

Nothing about the default appearance changes.

## Explicit encoding: the relationship, not just the two levels

- **`explicit =` computes a third channel** from the two sources
  (`"difference"`, `"ratio"`, `"log_ratio"` or `"z"`), and
  **`explicit_channel =`** decides where it goes:
  - `"eye_size"` (the default) puts the gap in the eyes, which already exist
    and are visually subordinate to the fills. Cells where the two sources
    agree exactly get no eye, so a plain glyph *means* agreement.
  - `"angle"` puts it in the glyph's tilt. Direction is read far more
    accurately than shading, so this is the most precise of the four: upright
    means the sources agree, and the lean shows which way and how far.
  - `"border"` puts it in the outline width, and `"radius"` in the glyph's
    size, scaled by area rather than by diameter (with the perceptual
    correction described under `radius_exponent` below).
  `explicit_range =` sets the output range. The statistic is rescaled across
  the whole layer, so facets stay comparable, and driving the same channel by
  hand as well is an error rather than a silent override.
- **`geom_taichi_diff()`** draws the same statistic as a diverging heatmap,
  with limits symmetric about "the two sources agree". Sometimes the right
  chart for "how much bigger?" is not a glyph, and the package would rather
  say so than insist.
- **`taichi_summary()`** returns the numbers per cell: both values, the
  difference, the ratio, the log ratio, the standardised difference, which
  source dominates, and the cell's rank by the size of the gap.
- A ratio of a zero or negative value is `NA`, never `Inf`, in all three, and
  the two geoms warn when that happens.

## Interactivity

- **`interactive = TRUE`** makes the fish and their eyes
  [ggiraph](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/) grobs, so
  `ggiraph::girafe()` turns the plot into a widget. This matters more than
  convenience: fill is the least accurate channel there is, and hovering is
  how a colour-encoded chart supplies exact values without abandoning its
  encoding. The default tooltip carries both values, their difference and the
  cell's coordinates.
- **`data_id_by =`** decides what a hover highlights: `"cell"` (both fish of
  one glyph, the default), `"fish"`, or `"source"`, which lights up every
  fish of one source at once, temporarily turning the superposition display
  into a single-source one. That is the one thing a static superposition
  cannot do.
- `tooltip`, `data_id` and `onclick` take a data column to override any of it.
- The static path is untouched: with `interactive = FALSE` the package does
  not load ggiraph at all, and the interactive geometry is identical to the
  static geometry. ggiraph is a Suggests-only dependency.
- plotly remains unsupported and will stay that way: `ggplotly()` cannot
  translate the custom grobs this package draws. The help page now says so.

## Palettes are a correctness problem, and now they are measurable

- **`taichi_check_palette()`** measures a pair of ramps: per-step luminance
  and chroma, the largest luminance mismatch, whether each ramp is monotone,
  and (with **colorspace** installed) how far apart the two stay
  under deuteranopia, protanopia and tritanopia, against a normal-vision
  baseline.
  Run on the package's own defaults it returns **FAIL**: the grey yin ramp
  spans the full luminance range while the red yang ramp stops around L* 41,
  a mismatch of about 41 units, so equal values have never read as equal ink.
  That is documented rather than quietly fixed; see below.
- **`taichi_palette_pair()`** builds a pair that differs only in hue, sharing
  one luminance and one chroma trajectory, so step for step the two fish carry
  the same visual weight.
- **`palette =`** on `geom_taichi()` selects a ready-made pair:
  `"balanced"` (the recommended one), `"diverging"`, `"viridis_pair"`,
  `"brewer_pair"`, `"greyscale_safe"` (a grey ramp and a hued ramp on the same
  luminance trajectory, so the figure survives greyscale printing), or
  `"default"`. **`taichi_palette()`** returns any of them for inspection.
- **The defaults do not change.** Every existing figure is unaffected. The
  honest fix is a different default, and that is a 1.0.0 decision with a
  prominent note, not something to slip into a minor release.

## Fill scales, including binned ones

- A family of ready fill scales: `scale_taichi_yin_c()` /
  `scale_taichi_yang_c()`, `scale_taichi_yin_d()` / `scale_taichi_yang_d()`,
  `scale_taichi_yin_binned()` / `scale_taichi_yang_binned()`, and
  `scale_taichi_yin_viridis_c()` / `_d()` with their yang counterparts. Pass
  them to `yin_scale` / `yang_scale`, or use them directly with the fish
  geoms.
- **Binning is the cheapest accuracy win available on a dense grid**, and the
  documentation now says so: matching a patch to one of five labelled bins is
  much closer to a categorical lookup than reading a position on a continuous
  luminance ramp.
- **`shared_limits` now composes with a supplied scale.** Previously the
  limits ggtaichi computed were dropped as soon as anyone brought their own
  scale, so `shared_limits = TRUE` silently did nothing next to a binned or
  viridis scale. They are now pushed into it (a scale that sets its own limits
  still wins), which is what makes binning both fish against one set of breaks
  work. `shared_legend` likewise drops the duplicate yang guide from a
  supplied scale.

## ggplot2 4.x currency

- **The geoms follow the theme.** ggplot2 4.0 lets a theme set geom defaults
  through `theme(geom = element_geom(ink, paper, accent))`; ggtaichi's
  fallbacks were hard-coded, so on a dark theme the fallback fish was nearly
  invisible and the two eyes were the wrong way round. Fill, outline colour,
  linewidth, linetype and both eye colours now read from the theme, resolving
  to exactly the previous values on any light theme. The eye-colour arguments
  default to `NULL`, meaning "ask the theme".
  The ggplot2 floor stays at 3.4.0: the theme-aware defaults are installed at
  load time when the installed ggplot2 supports them, and the literal
  fallbacks are used otherwise. Raising the floor to 4.0.0 is a 1.0.0
  decision.
- **`draw_key_taichi()`**: legend keys are now small taichi symbols with the
  layer's own fish filled, rather than plain rectangles, and they grow the
  layer's own eyes when it has them. `key_glyph = "rect"` restores the old keys, and
  `key_glyph` is a new argument of `geom_taichi()`, `geom_yin_fish()` and
  `geom_yang_fish()`. Keys only appear for discrete fills; a continuous fill
  still gets a colourbar.
- **`inst/CITATION`**, so `citation("ggtaichi")` gives a proper entry.
- New tests pin the things ggplot2's S7 migration could quietly break:
  `ggplot_add()` dispatch, the `+` chain, and the theme-aware defaults
  resolving to the historical appearance. The suite moves to testthat edition
  3, adds `expect_snapshot()` coverage of every print method and error
  message, and adds a vdiffr case per new channel.
- CI gains a coverage job and a weekly, non-blocking spelling and URL check.

## New aesthetics on the fish geoms

`geom_yin_fish()` and `geom_yang_fish()` additionally understand `radius` (a
proportion of the cell's own radius, so `0.5` draws a half-size glyph in the
same cell), `border` (a per-cell outline width in mm, overriding `linewidth`),
and `tooltip` / `data_id` / `onclick`. Both gain `interactive` and `key_glyph`
arguments.

## Bug fixes

- **gganimate transitions collapsed to a single frame.** Every animation this
  package has ever been able to produce was static. gganimate tracks which
  rows belong to which frame by encoding the frame into the `group` column, as
  a `"<id>"` suffix; the geom's `setup_data()` reset `group` to
  `seq_len(nrow(data))` whenever it held duplicates, which every transition
  produces, and threw that away, so `transition_states()`,
  `transition_manual()` and the rest all rendered one frame. The rewrite was
  dead code from the package's first commit (nothing in the draw path reads
  `group`, since each panel is batched into one polygon that numbers its own
  vertices), and removing it changes no static output (every vdiffr snapshot
  is unchanged). It went unnoticed because `vignette("animations")` builds the
  `gganim` object but leaves every `animate()` call commented out for CI, so
  the frames were never rendered. There is now a test that renders frames with
  `gganimate::file_renderer()`, which needs no gifski and no system libraries,
  and asserts the count.
- **The yin eye vanished on a theme with no background.** `theme_void()`, and
  any theme built with `rect = element_blank()`, leaves the theme's `paper`
  fully transparent, so the new theme-aware default painted the yin eye
  `#00000000`. A fully transparent `paper` now falls back to white (and a
  transparent `ink` to black), which also stops the fallback fill being mixed
  towards transparency instead of towards the page.
- **Glyphs turned upside down under a reversed coord.**
  `coord_cartesian(reverse = "y")` and `coord_transform(y = "reverse")` hand
  the cells over with their maximum below their minimum, and the negative size
  rotated every glyph by 180 degrees (yin eye at the bottom) and let the
  longer cell side set the radius, so glyphs could overflow their cells.
  (`scale_y_reverse()` was never affected.)
- **`theme_taichi(base_size =)` left the main text at its default size.** The
  axis titles, tick labels and plot title were fixed point sizes; they now
  scale with `base_size`. At the default of 11 nothing changes.
- **`yin_name` / `yang_name` were ignored for a scale object** passed as
  `yin_scale` / `yang_scale` (a constructor always got them). They now title
  it unless it names itself, and `shared_legend` gives it the joint title.
- **`geom_yin_fish()` / `geom_yang_fish()` ignored a mistyped flag**:
  `eyes = "yes"` quietly meant no eyes. `eyes` and `interactive` must now be
  `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
- **`remove_padding()` turned a date axis into day counts.** A `Date`
  column counts as continuous, so the axis was rebuilt with
  `scale_x_continuous()`, which threw the date labels away and printed the
  raw numbers (`18420`) in their place; every bundled data set carries such a
  column. A date, date-time or `hms` axis now keeps `scale_x_date()`,
  `scale_x_datetime()` or `scale_x_time()`, with the padding removed. As a
  result `remove_padding(x = "c", y = "d")` is resolved when it is added to
  the plot, like the auto-detecting form, instead of returning two scales
  straight away.
- **`geom_taichi()` took over a fill scale already on the plot.** Added after
  another fill layer (`geom_tile(aes(fill = z)) + scale_fill_viridis_c()`),
  its yin scale replaced that layer's scale, so the tiles were drawn in the
  grey yin ramp and both were trained on one range, washing the fish out; a
  plot-level `aes(fill = )` did the same to the yin fish on its own, and a
  second `geom_taichi()` repainted the first one's yang fish. It now starts a
  fresh fill scale first whenever the plot already uses fill, and so does
  `geom_taichi_diff()`, whose diverging scale laid over a taichi grid
  repainted the yang fish.
- **`drop = FALSE` crashed a factor fill with an unused level**
  ("Insufficient values in manual scale"): the palette was sized from the
  levels present, not from the levels the scale was asked to keep. With
  `shared_limits`, the unused levels are now kept in the shared set as well.
- **`coord_polar()` drew one oversized glyph in a corner.** It moves the cell
  centres but not the cell boxes the glyph is drawn in, so the boxes stayed in
  data units. `coord_polar()`, `coord_radial()` and `coord_map()` are now an
  error naming the coords that work, rather than a wrong picture.
- **A plotmath legend title broke the plot.** `yin_name = bquote(mu * g)` (or
  any call or symbol) was evaluated by the `do.call()` that builds the scales
  instead of being passed on, and `print()` of a `geom_taichi()` or
  `geom_taichi_diff()` object failed on an `expression()` title.
- **An error inside a supplied scale constructor was misreported** as "the
  supplied scale declares no aesthetics". It is now reported as itself, under
  "`yin_scale` failed to build a fill scale".

## Fixes and corrections in this cycle

Found by auditing 0.3.0 against its own documentation before release. None of
these has appeared in a CRAN release, so all are corrections rather than
breaking changes.

- **Only the first glyph of each fish layer was interactive.** ggiraph reads
  the attributes of an id-batched polygon at each polygon's first vertex,
  and the fish handed it one value per cell, so in the widget every glyph
  after the first had no tooltip and no `data_id`: hovering it showed
  nothing and highlighted nothing (the eyes were unaffected). The attributes
  now go in one per vertex, and a test reads them back out of `girafe()`'s
  SVG rather than off the grob.
- **The yin and yang legends could swap places between sessions.** Both
  auto-built fill guides were left at ggplot2's default `order`, and the tie
  was broken by something that is not stable across R sessions: the same plot,
  the same package and the same ggplot2 could put yin first in one render and
  yang first in the next. One of the committed vdiffr references had in fact
  recorded the wrong order, which is how it was found. Yin is now pinned
  before yang, matching the argument order and every example in the
  documentation. An explicit `guide` passed through `...` still wins (and
  is pinned the same way unless it asks for an order itself), and
  `shared_legend` still drops the yang guide. A supplied `yin_scale` /
  `yang_scale` is pinned the same way unless it asks for an order itself:
  left alone, the two legends were sorted by a hash of their contents, and
  the committed binned snapshot had recorded yang first.
- **`vignette("animations")` now really renders its animations.** Every
  `animate()` call in it was commented out, because gifski is not installed on
  every check machine, and since building a `gganim` object succeeds whether
  or not the transition works, nothing ever noticed that the geom was
  collapsing every animation to a single frame. The calls now execute through
  `gganimate::file_renderer()`, which needs no gifski and no system libraries,
  and emit a GIF on top of that wherever gifski exists. A demonstration that is
  never run is not a demonstration.
- **`palette = "print_safe"` is renamed `"greyscale_safe"`.** The preset
  guarantees that the two ramps collapse to the same ink in *greyscale*; it
  says nothing about the CMYK gamut, which is what most readers understand by
  "print safe". The name over-promised. Renamed now because the preset is new
  in this cycle and has never been released.
- **`explicit_channel = "radius"` gains `radius_exponent`, defaulting to
  0.57.** The radius was scaled by `sqrt()`, strict area scaling, which was a
  silent choice. Cartography's answer for proportional symbols is the
  apparent-magnitude (Flannery) exponent of about 0.57, because readers
  systematically underestimate the area ratio between large and small circles.
  `radius_exponent = 0.5` restores the previous behaviour.
- **`taichi_check_palette()` now names the colour space it measured in.**
  Every number it prints is space-dependent and none of them said so, which
  made them impossible to check against another tool.
- **`taichi_summary()` documents a caveat on `rank`.** The widest gap in a
  96-cell grid is frequently the largest noise; `rank` lists places to look,
  not findings.
- **`geom_taichi()` documents two things the mark cannot do.** A sequential
  discrete palette asserts an ordering, which suits an ordered factor and
  overstates an unordered one; and putting time on `x` encodes the series in
  fill rather than position, so slope is not encoded at all.
- **A scale object passed as `yin_scale` / `yang_scale` was modified in
  place.** Scales are shared by reference, so the shared limits and the
  dropped yang guide followed the object into every other plot it was used
  in. They now go on a copy.
- **Reusing one `interactive = TRUE` object in a second plot broke the first**:
  filling in the default tooltip wrote into layers the two plots shared.
- **Tooltips.** Under `shared_legend` the yin value was labelled with the joint
  legend title (`matcha / espresso: 35`); each source is now named by its own
  column. A category or cell label containing `<` or `&` is now escaped like a
  column name, instead of breaking the tooltip's markup.
- **`scale_taichi_yin_d()` / `scale_taichi_yang_d()`** treated an explicit
  `colors` vector as a ramp, so `c("red", "blue")` came out purple and blue;
  it is now used as given, as in `geom_taichi()`. They also failed outright on
  ggplot2 3.4, the supported floor, which still requires `discrete_scale()`'s
  `scale_name`.
- **Legend key eyes** were always white and black at the default size. A
  single-fish key now takes its layer's eye colour and constant eye size, so
  the key matches the plot and follows a dark theme.
- **`explicit`** warned twice about a non-positive ratio (once per fish), and
  now warns once. A `border` missing from some cells keeps the layer's
  `linewidth` there instead of dropping to 0.1, a non-numeric mapped `border`
  is an error, and the deprecated `size` counts as `linewidth` when checking
  for a clash with `explicit_channel = "border"`. When every cell agrees, the
  `angle` channel now sits at the middle of a custom `explicit_range`, where
  the signed mapping puts agreement.
- **`taichi_summary()`** failed ("factor level is duplicated") when a column
  was compared with itself or was called `tie`, and gave a missing value in a
  constant column a `z` of 0 rather than `NA`.
- **`geom_taichi_diff()`** took its symmetric limits from the plot's data even
  when the tiles had a `data` of their own, and its `"z"` legend read
  `z( a ) - z( b )`.
- **Messages.** A misspelt `palette =` preset was reported as a bad `name`, an
  argument the caller never passed; `geom_taichi_diff()`'s palette error now
  names its three-colour form; `taichi_check_palette()` checks `tolerance`.
- **Checks without the suggested packages.** An example and two tests used
  ggiraph or colorspace unguarded, which fails wherever those Suggests are
  absent, and one test only matched ggplot2 4's wording of an error.
- **Documentation.** The README misread its Pittsburgh grid (Covid is dark in
  both halves, not pale pink); the vignette's one-cell anatomy plot drew both
  fish mid-ramp whatever their values; `explicit_channel = "radius"` was still
  described as square-root scaling; the claim that a non-positive ratio warns
  in all three places is corrected (`taichi_summary()` does not); and the
  animations vignette counted three releases where there were two.
- **`explicit = "ratio"` measured the gap from 0.** A ratio's agreement point
  is 1, and every ratio is positive, so a cell where the two sources were
  equal got a mid-sized eye (or a tilt, a thicker border, a larger glyph)
  where the documentation promises none. Every channel now measures the
  distance from agreement, 1 for `"ratio"` and 0 for the other statistics.
- **An all-agreeing grid drew every glyph at full size on the radius
  channel**, which on that channel means the widest gap, and a single
  disagreeing cell then shrank all the others; a custom `explicit_range` was
  likewise ignored there for the eyes and the border. Every cell now gets the
  channel's agreement end, as it would next to a disagreeing one.
- **`shared_limits` put a transformed scale object on the wrong limits.** A
  continuous scale keeps its limits in transformed units, and the shared
  limits were written into a supplied object in raw units, so on a
  `transform = "log10"` scale most cells fell below the lower limit and were
  painted `na.value`. A constructor was never affected.
- **Tooltip numbers went scientific from five digits on**: an order count of
  12000 read `1.2e+04` and 123456 lost two digits as `1.235e+05`. They now
  stay in fixed notation (four significant digits) except at magnitudes where
  that would be a run of zeros, and a plotmath legend title reaches the
  tooltip as text instead of being evaluated.
- **Errors name the function the user called.** Several reported an internal
  helper instead (`Error in pull()`, `resolve_values()`, `check_colours()`,
  `as_palette_pair()`), and `geom_taichi_diff()` blamed an `explicit`
  argument it does not have. A bad `yin_colors` / `yang_colors` is named
  when `geom_taichi()` is called instead of surfacing at print time as an
  anonymous "Unknown colour name". Infinite values are now refused wherever a
  finite number is needed (`n`, `hues`, `chroma`, `luminance`, which must also
  lie between 0 and 100, `explicit_range`, `radius_exponent`, `midpoint` and a
  constant eye size): `chroma = Inf` used to return a ramp of `NA` colours
  without a word.
- **`palette =` gave a discrete fill the palest steps of its ramp.** A preset
  was taken verbatim, like an explicit colour vector, so a three-level factor
  got the first three of the preset's five colours: the light half of the
  ramp, the first level close to invisible on a white panel. A palette is now
  sampled as the ramp it is, palest end skipped, as the built-in colours are
  and as `scale_taichi_yin_d(palette = )` already did. Explicit
  `yin_colors` / `yang_colors` are still used as given.
- **The single legend `shared_legend` keeps now fills both halves of its
  keys.** It governs both fish, and a key with only the yin half filled read
  as a legend for the top fish alone. An explicit `key_glyph` still wins.
- **`vignette("animations")` recommended `enter_grow()` for a grow-in
  reveal**, which has no visible effect on the glyphs. It now says what the
  enter and exit effects do here: cells pop in and out, `enter_drift()`
  moves them, and `enter_fade()` / `enter_recolour()` stop with an error on
  any plot with a ggnewscale break (a gganimate limitation that plain
  `geom_tile()` layers share).
- **`?geom_taichi` says what the default hover ids do under facets**: they
  name a cell by its `x` and `y`, so the same cell lights up in every panel.
- **Running the tests without vdiffr deleted the committed visual
  references.** At the end of a full local run testthat removes every snapshot
  file that no test announced, and a skipped `expect_doppelganger()`
  announces nothing. Each visual test now announces its reference before any
  skip, and the visual tests also skip themselves on a ggplot2 older than the
  one the references were drawn with, where every comparison would fail for
  reasons that have nothing to do with ggtaichi.

## Deprecations and notes

- The `size` argument of `geom_taichi()`, soft-deprecated in favour of
  `linewidth` since 0.2.0, will be **removed in 1.0.0**. It still works, and
  still warns.
- `geom_taichi()` now takes around thirty arguments, which is a design smell
  the roadmap has flagged. Grouping them into option objects
  (`taichi_eyes()`, `taichi_scales()`, ...) is intended to land *before* the
  next wave of glyph channels, not after.
- **The lifecycle badge moves to `stable`.** The API has been through three
  releases without a breaking change: 0.3.0 added arguments but removed and
  altered nothing, and every plot written against 0.1.0 or 0.2.0 still draws
  the same picture. `stable` is a promise about breakage, not a promise to
  stop adding features, and that promise the package can keep.

# ggtaichi 0.2.0

## New features

- **Data-driven eyes** (`eyes = TRUE`): draw the classic taichi dots, each
  centred in its own fish's head (yin in the top bulb, yang in the bottom
  bulb). `yin_eye_size` / `yang_eye_size` and `yin_eye_colour` /
  `yang_eye_colour` accept either a constant or an unquoted data column, so a
  single glyph can now encode up to **six** dimensions (x, y, two fills, two
  eyes) (#3b).
- **Rotation** (`angle`): rotate each glyph by a constant number of degrees or
  by a data column, encoding a directional or temporal variable as
  orientation, and unlocking spin animations (#3a).
- **Categorical fill support**: `geom_taichi()` inspects the plot data at `+`
  time and auto-selects `scale_fill_manual()` for discrete (factor /
  character / logical) `yin` / `yang` values, including computed expressions
  such as `factor(week)`, and `scale_fill_gradientn()` for continuous ones.
  With the default color vectors, discrete categories sample the ramp evenly
  while skipping its palest end, so no category is invisible on a white
  panel. Custom scales (objects or constructors) can be supplied via
  `yin_scale` / `yang_scale` (#4a, BUG-4).
- **Shared scales** for directly comparable sources (#4b):
  - `shared_limits = TRUE` gives both auto-built fill scales common limits
    (the union range of the two sources, or the union of levels when both are
    discrete), so equal values read as equal ink. Explicit `limits` passed
    through `...` still win, and mixing a discrete with a continuous source
    warns and ignores the flag.
  - `shared_legend = TRUE` treats the sources as one measure: it implies
    shared limits, paints both fish with `yin_colors`, drops the duplicate
    yang guide, and titles the single legend "`yin` / `yang`" unless
    `yin_name` is supplied.
- **The fish geoms are exported** (#4d): `geom_yin_fish()` and
  `geom_yang_fish()` are now documented exports (with the `GeomYinFish` /
  `GeomYangFish` ggproto objects available for extension packages), for
  users who want a single fish or full manual control over scale stacking.
- **`remove_padding()` auto mode**: called with no arguments it now detects
  each axis's scale type from the plot it is added to; the explicit
  `"c"` / `"d"` arguments remain as overrides.
- **New dataset `cafes_tg`**: a small, clearly synthetic (seeded) espresso
  vs. matcha dataset whose two columns share units: an evergreen demo for
  the shared-scale features and a break from the COVID-era examples. The
  generating script ships in `data-raw/`.
- `yin` and `yang` also accept strings naming a column (`yin = "Twitter"`),
  which previously produced a meaningless constant fill.
- `geom_taichi()` now returns an object with a friendly `print()` method
  instead of dumping raw list internals at the console.
- **Animation vignette**: `vignette("animations")` documents how
  `geom_taichi()` composes with gganimate (`transition_states()`, spin
  animations via `angle`, export recipes), said to be verified frame-by-frame
  against gganimate 1.0.11 (it was not; see 0.3.0). gganimate is a
  Suggests-only dependency.

## Performance

- **Vectorized rendering**: each layer now draws all of its cells as one
  id-batched polygon (plus one batched circle grob for the eyes), resolved
  against the physical panel size at draw time via `makeContent()`. Glyphs
  stay perfectly round under resize, and large grids render an order of
  magnitude faster than the per-cell grob building used in 0.1.0: a
  1200-cell grid with eyes takes 0.24 s to build and draw versus ~3.5 s
  with the per-cell approach (~15x, same machine), with pixel-identical
  output.

## Bug fixes

- **Mapped `eye_size = 0` drew an eye (#1)**: a mapped eye-size of `0` was
  rescaled to a positive radius, so an eye was drawn despite the documented
  "0 → no eye" rule. Zeros are now preserved and drawn without an eye.
- **A zero disabled the eye-size pass-through for the whole column**: because
  `0` is excluded from the documented `(0, 0.5]` pass-through range, a single
  "no eye here" zero made every other value in an otherwise-proportional
  column go through the `[0.05, 0.3]` rescale instead: `c(0, 0.2, 0.4)`
  drew eyes of `0, 0.175, 0.3`. Zeros are markers rather than measurements, so
  they no longer take part in that decision; the column now draws `0, 0.2,
  0.4`, and the two documented rules compose as intended.
- **`shared_legend` palette mismatch (#2)**: with `shared_legend = TRUE` and
  discrete fills, the yang fish was painted with a differently-interpolated
  palette than the yin fish when only one of `yin_colors` / `yang_colors` was
  supplied. Both fish now use `yin_colors`, so identical categories read as
  identical ink.
- **`states_tg` documentation (#3)**: the dataset spans 31 weeks (the bundled
  data has 31); the documentation said 30. Corrected to 31 (the data is
  unchanged).
- **`...` routing (BUG-1)**: geom parameters (`alpha`, `colour`, `linewidth`,
  `linetype`, `width`, `height`, `na.rm`, `show.legend`) are now real,
  documented arguments of `geom_taichi()` and are forwarded to the underlying
  fish layers. `...` is reserved for options applied to both fill scales
  (e.g. shared `limits`); per-fish scale control goes through `yin_scale` /
  `yang_scale`.
- **`linewidth` aesthetic (BUG-2)**: the outline width now uses the modern
  `linewidth` aesthetic. Passing `size` to `geom_taichi()` still works but
  warns and is routed to `linewidth`, and an inherited `aes(size = ...)`
  mapping is renamed through ggplot2's built-in deprecation path. ggtaichi
  now requires ggplot2 >= 3.4.0.
- **Missing-argument validation (BUG-3)**: omitting `yin` or `yang` errors
  immediately with a clear message instead of silently producing a degenerate
  grey plot, and a `yin` / `yang` column that does not exist in the plot data
  errors at `+` time with the offending name.
- **Categorical fills (BUG-4)**: factor / character columns no longer trigger
  the cryptic "Discrete value supplied to a continuous scale" error (see the
  categorical fill support above).
- **Non-finite `angle` and `eye_size` values**: the guards tested `is.na()`,
  which is `TRUE` for `NA` and `NaN` but not for `Inf` / `-Inf`. An infinite
  angle therefore reached `cos()` / `sin()`, turned every vertex of that glyph
  into `NaN` and drew nothing while warning "NaNs produced"; an infinite mapped
  eye size asked grid for a circle of infinite radius. Both now test
  `is.finite()`, so a non-finite angle falls back to no rotation and a
  non-finite eye size means no eye, exactly as `NA` already did.
- **Non-numeric `angle` columns**: mapping `angle` to a character column
  failed at draw time with the base error "non-numeric argument to binary
  operator", and mapping it to a *factor* silently drew unrotated glyphs
  alongside `'*' not meaningful for factors` warnings. Both now error at build
  time with a clear message, matching how a non-numeric `eye_size` column is
  already handled.
- **Explicit discrete `limits`**: passing `limits` through `...` for a
  factor / character fish aborted with "Insufficient values in manual scale"
  whenever the limits held more entries than the data had levels. The
  auto-built palette is now sized against the limits.
- **A custom scale for the wrong aesthetic drew the wrong plot silently**:
  passing e.g. `yin_scale = scale_colour_viridis_c` attached the scale to
  `colour`, which the fish never map, so the fish fell back to ggplot2's
  default blue fill gradient with no error at all. `yin_scale` / `yang_scale`
  are now checked to govern a fill aesthetic, and a value that is neither a
  scale object nor a constructor function reports that instead of the base
  error "'what' must be a function or character string".
- **Non-numeric cell `width` / `height`** failed inside `setup_data()` with
  "non-numeric argument to binary operator"; now reported directly.
- **`...` colliding with the scale options `geom_taichi()` sets itself**:
  `guide` together with `shared_legend = TRUE` aborted with the base error
  "formal argument `guide` matched by multiple actual arguments". The
  internally computed options now take precedence, so the yang guide is still
  dropped while a user-supplied `guide` styles the shared legend. Passing
  `name`, `values`, `colors`, or `colours` through `...` now reports which
  per-fish argument to use instead of raising the same base error.
- **`theme_taichi()` no longer clips text at the plot edges**: the title is
  now aligned with the whole plot area (`plot.title.position = "plot"`) and
  slightly smaller (15 instead of 18), so realistic titles fit at typical
  figure sizes, and the right plot margin is a touch wider so an axis label
  sitting on the panel boundary (common with `remove_padding()`) is not cut
  off.
- **`theme_taichi()` element inheritance**: because the theme is composed with
  `%+replace%`, three properties `theme_bw()` had set were silently dropped and
  fell back to the generic `text` / `rect` parents. The rice-paper canvas
  picked up a near-black 1px border around the whole plot, the y-axis tick
  labels lost their right alignment and their gap from the panel, and the
  legend title lost its left alignment. All three are restored.

## Documentation

- New pkgdown-only **gallery** article showing palettes, data-driven eyes,
  rotation, categorical fills, shared scales, and dense-grid texture.
- New **"When (not) to use taichi"** section in the intro vignette: honest
  guidance on dense grids, luminance precision, colorblind-safe palettes
  (viridis via `yin_scale` / `yang_scale`), and NA visibility.
- New **Styling** section in `?geom_taichi`: `alpha`, `colour`, `linewidth` and
  `linetype` are layer-wide constants there (each has a concrete default, so it
  is always forwarded as a layer parameter and outranks an inherited mapping),
  so map those through `geom_yin_fish()` / `geom_yang_fish()` instead. `width` and
  `height` default to `NULL` and are forwarded only when supplied, so a
  plot-level `aes(width = ...)` does size the cells per row.
- `?theme_taichi` now spells out its two surprising choices (the blanked y
  axis title, so `labs(y = )` has no effect, and the 90-degree legend text),
  together with the `theme()` calls that put either back.
- `?remove_padding` now states that `...` reaches *both* position scales, so
  with axes of different types only arguments common to continuous and
  discrete scales work there, and that auto-detection reads the plot's mapping
  (name the type explicitly when `x` / `y` are mapped in a layer instead).
- `?pitts_emojis` now documents the actual format (HTML `<img>` tags aligned
  row-for-row with `pitts_tg`) and notes that the remote images it points at
  are no longer served.

## Internal

- Added a **testthat** suite (argument validation, `taichi_fish()` geometry
  down to a Monte-Carlo tiling check, parameter routing, rotation, eyes,
  discrete-scale selection, grob-level rendering checks) plus **vdiffr**
  visual-regression snapshots.
- Two gaps in that suite are closed. It now covers **non-square cells** (the
  per-cell box following `width` on x and `height` on y, and the glyph radius
  coming from the shorter cell side), which every `coord_fixed()` snapshot is
  blind to. It also pins the **direction** of all three places rotation is
  applied (`taichi_fish()`, the vectorised body rotation in `makeContent()`,
  and the eye placement), so a sign error in any one of them fails a test.
- `tests/testthat/setup.R` holds a null device open for the run, so the suite
  no longer leaves a stray `Rplots.pdf` in `tests/testthat/`.
- `geom_taichi()` now returns a `ggtaichi_plot` object added to the plot via
  a `ggplot_add()` method, which is what makes data-aware scale selection
  and shared limits possible.

# ggtaichi 0.1.0

- Initial version.
- `geom_taichi()` turns each cell of a grid into a taichi (yin-yang) diagram,
  filling the two fish with values from two data sources.
- Added `theme_taichi()` and `remove_padding()` helpers.
- Bundled the `pitts_tg`, `states_tg`, and `pitts_emojis` data sets.
