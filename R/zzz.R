# Theme-aware geom defaults, applied at load time.
#
# ggplot2 4.0 lets a theme set geom defaults through
# `theme(geom = element_geom(ink, paper, accent))`, and lets a geom read them
# with `from_theme()`. Without that, ggtaichi's hard-coded fallbacks (a
# grey20 fish, a white yin eye, a black yang eye) do not follow a dark
# theme: on a dark `paper` the fallback fish is nearly invisible and the two
# eyes are the wrong way round.
#
# The expressions below reproduce the current appearance exactly on the
# default light theme, where ink black, paper white and borderwidth 0.5 give
# a #333333 fill (grey20), a linewidth of 0.1, a white yin eye and a black
# yang eye, and flip with the theme otherwise. They are installed here rather
# than written into the ggproto definitions so that the package still works,
# with the literal fallbacks, on the ggplot2 3.4-3.5 it still supports, and so
# that upgrading ggplot2 after installing ggtaichi is enough to switch them on
# without a reinstall.
# The names below are supplied by ggplot2 as a data mask when it evaluates a
# from_theme() expression. They are theme element properties, not objects in
# this namespace, so R's static check cannot see where they come from.
