#' Summarise the two sources cell by cell
#'
#' A taichi grid is a *superposition* comparison: the two sources share one
#' position, which makes "are these similar?" and "which is bigger here?" easy
#' to see and "by how much?" impossible. `taichi_summary()` is the tidy answer
#' to the last question: the numbers behind the glyph, one row per input
#' row, for the reader who needs a table rather than a picture.
#'
#' @section The statistics:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{`difference`}{`yin - yang`. Positive means the yin fish (the top
#'     bulb) carries the larger value.}
#'   \item{`ratio`}{`yin / yang`, and `NA` wherever either value is not
#'     strictly positive (a ratio of a negative or zero quantity is not a
#'     ratio), so `Inf` is never returned.}
#'   \item{`log_ratio`}{`log2(yin / yang)`, so a value of 1 means yin is twice
#'     yang and -1 means half. Symmetric around zero, which `ratio` is not,
#'     and the right choice when the two sources span orders of magnitude.}
#'   \item{`z`}{The difference of the two standardised sources: each column is
#'     centred and scaled across the whole grid, then subtracted. This is the
#'     statistic to use when the two sources are *not* in the same units,
#'     because it asks "which source is unusually high here, relative to its
#'     own spread?" rather than "which number is bigger?".}
#'   \item{`dominant`}{Which source is larger in that cell, named after the
#'     columns supplied, or `"tie"`.}
#'   \item{`rank`}{The cell's rank by size of `abs(difference)`, 1 being the
#'     widest gap. Cells with a missing difference get `NA`.}
#' }
#'
#' @section A caveat on `rank`:
#' A grid of 96 cells is 96 implicit comparisons, and the most extreme cell in
#' a grid that size is frequently the most extreme *noise* rather than the
#' largest real effect. Treat `rank` as a list of places to look, not as a
#' list of findings: taking the top-ranked cell and reporting it is the
#' multiple-comparisons problem in miniature. With one observation per cell
#' there is no per-cell test to correct with, so the honest check is on the
#' field as a whole.
#'
#' @param data A data frame, the same one passed to [ggplot2::ggplot()].
#' @param yin,yang Unquoted column names (or strings naming columns) for the
#'   two sources, exactly as in [geom_taichi()].
#' @param x,y Optional unquoted column names identifying each cell. When
#'   given they are carried through to the output as the first columns, which
#'   makes the result joinable back onto the plotting data.
#'
#' @return A data frame with one row per row of `data`: the optional `x` and
#'   `y` cell identifiers, `yin`, `yang`, `difference`, `ratio`, `log_ratio`,
#'   `z`, `dominant` and `rank`.
#' @seealso [geom_taichi()]'s `explicit` argument, which shows one of these
#'   statistics inside the glyph, and [geom_taichi_diff()], which draws it as
#'   a diverging heatmap.

#' The difference between the two sources, as a heatmap
#'
#' Sometimes the right chart for "how much bigger?" is not a glyph at all but
#' a diverging heatmap, and a package that offers one next to its signature
#' mark is more useful than one that insists on the mark. `geom_taichi_diff()`
#' computes one of [taichi_summary()]'s statistics per cell and draws it with
#' [ggplot2::geom_tile()] on a diverging scale centred on "the two sources
#' agree".
#'
#' It is the explicit-encoding companion to [geom_taichi()]: same data, same
#' grid, same statistics, but the relationship itself is on the page instead
#' of being left to the reader's eye. Use it beside a taichi grid, not instead
#' of one: the glyph shows the levels, this shows the gap.
#'
#' @param yin,yang Unquoted column names (or strings naming columns) for the
#'   two sources, as in [geom_taichi()].
#' @param method Which statistic to draw: `"difference"` (`yin - yang`, the
#'   default), `"ratio"`, `"log_ratio"` or `"z"`. See [taichi_summary()] for
#'   the definitions; `"log_ratio"` is the better choice than `"ratio"`
#'   whenever the two sources span orders of magnitude, because it is
#'   symmetric around agreement.
#' @param palette The diverging colours: the name of a [taichi_palette()]
#'   preset (the yang ramp's dark end becomes the low colour, the yin ramp's
#'   dark end the high colour, so the tile agrees with the glyph), a list with
#'   `yin` and `yang` elements, or a character vector of exactly three
#'   colours giving `low`, `mid` and `high` directly.
#' @param name Legend title. Defaults to a label naming the statistic and the
#'   two columns, e.g. `"matcha - espresso"`.
#' @param midpoint The value that counts as "the sources agree" and is painted
#'   in the mid colour. Defaults to 1 for `"ratio"` and 0 for every other
#'   method.
#' @param symmetric If `TRUE` (the default) the fill limits are made
#'   symmetric about `midpoint`, so the mid colour really does sit at the
#'   centre of the legend and the two directions are coloured comparably.
#'   Set it to `FALSE` to use the plain data range.
#' @param na.value Colour for cells whose statistic is missing, which
#'   includes every non-positive cell under `"ratio"` and `"log_ratio"`.
#' @param ... Further arguments passed to [ggplot2::geom_tile()], for example
#'   `width`, `height`, `colour` or `linewidth`. A `data` given here is also
#'   what the symmetric limits are computed from.
#'
#' @return An object that, added to a [ggplot2::ggplot()] with `+`, draws the
#'   difference tiles and their diverging fill scale. It is not a plot on its
#'   own.
#' @seealso [taichi_summary()] for the same numbers as a table, and
