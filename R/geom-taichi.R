#' Taichi
#'
#' The taichi geom turns each cell of a heatmap-like grid into a taichi
#' (yin-yang) diagram. The two interlocking "fish" of the diagram use luminance
#' to show the values from two data sources on the same plot, so four
#' dimensions of data can be expressed at once: the \code{x} and \code{y}
#' position of every taichi symbol plus the \code{yin} and \code{yang} values
#' that fill its two halves. With the optional eyes enabled and mapped to data
#' (see \code{eyes}, \code{yin_eye_size}, \code{yang_eye_size}), a single glyph
#' can carry up to six dimensions.
#'
#' A seventh channel, \code{angle}, rotates the glyph, and \code{explicit}
#' adds an eighth that is \emph{computed} rather than mapped: the relationship
#' between the two sources, shown as a third channel of the same mark. See
#' the Explicit encoding section.
#'
#' @section Discrete and continuous fills:
#' \code{geom_taichi()} inspects the plot data at \code{+} time. A numeric
#' \code{yin} / \code{yang} column gets a continuous
#' \code{\link[ggplot2]{scale_fill_gradientn}} built from \code{yin_colors} /
#' \code{yang_colors}; a factor, character, or logical column (including
#' computed expressions such as \code{factor(week)}) gets a discrete
#' \code{\link[ggplot2]{scale_fill_manual}} whose palette is interpolated from
#' the same color vectors. With the default vectors, or a \code{palette}, the
#' discrete palette samples the ramp and skips its palest end so that no
#' category is invisible on a white panel; an explicitly supplied color vector
#' is used as-is, one colour per level in order. Supply
#' \code{yin_scale} / \code{yang_scale} to override the automatic choice
#' entirely. Each fish has its own fill scale, so a fill scale added to the
#' plot afterwards (\code{+ scale_fill_viridis_c()}) replaces the yang one
#' only; pass it as \code{yang_scale} instead.
#'
#' The automatic discrete palette samples a \emph{sequential} ramp, which
#' implies that the levels are ordered. That suits an ordered factor and
#' overstates an unordered one: if your categories have no natural order,
#' supply a qualitative palette through \code{yin_colors} / \code{yang_colors}
#' or a scale through \code{yin_scale} / \code{yang_scale}, so the fill does
#' not assert a ranking the data does not have.
#'
#' The glyphs are drawn from the plot's own data, the data the scales are
#' chosen from, so \code{geom_taichi()} has no \code{data} argument; to draw
#' one fish from other data, use \code{\link{geom_yin_fish}()} /
#' \code{\link{geom_yang_fish}()}, which take one.
#'
#' Because the choice is made when the layer is added, replacing the plot's
#' data afterwards keeps the scales picked for the original data. Swapping in
#' data of the same types is fine; if the new \code{yin} / \code{yang} columns
#' are of the \emph{other} kind, ggplot2 reports a "Discrete value supplied to
#' a continuous scale" (or the reverse) at draw time. Rebuild the plot rather
#' than substituting its data.
#'
#' @section Eyes:
#' \code{eyes = TRUE} draws the classic taichi dots, each sitting in its own
#' fish's head: the yin eye in the top bulb, the yang eye in the bottom bulb.
#' The size and colour arguments accept either a constant or an (unquoted)
#' data column, so the eyes can encode up to two further variables. A mapped
#' eye-size column is rescaled to radii between 0.05 and 0.3 of the glyph
#' radius, unless all its non-zero values already lie in \code{(0, 0.5]}, in
#' which case they are used directly as radius proportions. Cells whose eye
#' size is \code{NA} or \code{0} are drawn without an eye, so a column may
#' mix proportions with zeros to suppress individual eyes. A column whose
#' values are all equal, and not already proportions, gets the midpoint
#' radius, 0.175.
#'
#' @section Styling:
#' \code{alpha}, \code{colour}, \code{linewidth} and \code{linetype} are
#' layer-wide constants here. Each has a concrete default, so
#' \code{geom_taichi()} always passes it to both fish layers as a parameter,
#' and a parameter takes precedence over an inherited mapping: a plot-level
#' \code{aes(linewidth = ...)} (or \code{alpha}, \code{colour},
#' \code{linetype}) has no effect on the glyphs. To drive one of those from a
#' column, build the layers yourself with \code{\link{geom_yin_fish}()} /
#' \code{\link{geom_yang_fish}()}, which take all four as ordinary
#' aesthetics.
#'
#' \code{width} and \code{height} behave differently, because they default to
#' \code{NULL} and are forwarded only when you actually supply them: a
#' plot-level \code{aes(width = ...)} \emph{does} size the cells per row. So
#' the data-driven channels of \code{geom_taichi()} are \code{yin},
#' \code{yang}, \code{angle}, the two eyes, and \code{width} / \code{height}
#' via \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}()}.
#'
#' @section Missing values:
#' A fish whose fill value is \code{NA} is painted in the scale's
#' \code{na.value} colour (pass e.g. \code{na.value = "transparent"} through
#' \code{...} to change it), while \code{na.rm = TRUE} silently drops rows
#' with missing positions.
#'
#' @section Time on an axis:
#' Putting time on \code{x} makes each row of the grid a time series drawn as
#' a row of discrete glyphs, and the series is then encoded in \emph{fill}
#' rather than in position, so slope is not encoded at all and a reader
#' infers a trend by comparing the shade of neighbouring cells. That is a poor
#' substitute for a line. Use a taichi grid for the question \emph{which
#' series differ from each other, and where}; put a line chart or a horizon
#' plot beside it for \emph{what is the trend}.
#'
#' @section Explicit encoding:
#' Two fish sharing one position is a \emph{superposition} comparison. It is
#' very good at "are these similar?" and "which is bigger here?", and it
#' cannot answer "by how much?", because that needs the relationship itself
#' to be computed and drawn. \code{explicit} does exactly that, turning one of
#' \code{"difference"} (\code{yin - yang}), \code{"ratio"},
#' \code{"log_ratio"} or \code{"z"} into a third channel of the glyph. The
#' statistics are the ones \code{\link{taichi_summary}()} tabulates, including
#' its rule that a ratio of a non-positive value is \code{NA} rather than
#' \code{Inf}.
#'
#' Every channel shows how far the statistic is from agreement, which is 0
#' for every statistic except \code{"ratio"}, whose agreement is 1. A ratio
#' is measured by its plain distance from 1, so a ratio of 2 reads as a wider
#' gap than one of 0.5; use \code{"log_ratio"} when a doubling and a halving
#' should look alike.
#'
#' \code{explicit_channel} chooses where it goes:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{"eye_size"}}{The default, and the tidiest: the eyes already
#'     exist and are visually subordinate to the fills, so the two fish keep
#'     carrying the two sources while eye size carries the gap between them.
#'     A big eye reads as "look here", which is what a big gap means. Cells
#'     where the two sources agree exactly get no eye at all, so a plain glyph
#'     means agreement. Implies \code{eyes = TRUE}.}
#'   \item{\code{"angle"}}{The most \emph{accurate} option. Direction and
#'     angle are read far more precisely than shading, so encoding the gap as
#'     tilt makes it legible to a precision the fills can never reach: an
#'     upright glyph means the two sources agree and the lean shows which way
#'     and how far. The cost is the symbol's upright orientation, which is why
#'     it is a choice rather than the default.}
#'   \item{\code{"border"}}{Outline width. Unobtrusive, and it composes with
#'     everything else, but the least precise of the four. Because the default
#'     \code{colour} is \code{NA} (no outline at all), this channel gives the
#'     outline a visible colour unless you set \code{colour} yourself.}
#'   \item{\code{"radius"}}{Glyph size, scaled by area rather than by
#'     diameter so that the eye's area-based reading is the correct one: the
#'     radius follows the statistic raised to \code{radius_exponent}, a touch
#'     above the square root that strict area scaling would use. Cells where
#'     the sources agree shrink; use it when the interesting thing is
#'     \emph{where} they disagree.}
#' }
#'
#' \code{explicit_range} sets the channel's output range; each channel has a
#' sensible default (\code{c(0, 0.3)} of the glyph radius for eyes,
#' \code{c(-45, 45)} degrees for angle, \code{c(0, 1)} mm for the border,
#' \code{c(0.4, 1)} of the cell for radius). The statistic is rescaled across
#' the whole layer, so the mapping is comparable between facets.
#'
#' \code{\link{geom_taichi_diff}()} draws the same statistic as a diverging
#' heatmap when the glyph is not the right chart for the question, and
#' \code{\link{taichi_summary}()} returns it as a table.
#'
#' @section Palettes:
#' The two ramps are compared against each other, so they need to be matched:
#' if one spans a wider luminance range than the other then equal values do
#' not read as equal ink and one fish looks heavier wherever the data says the
#' sources are level. The default grey-and-red pair is \emph{not} matched
#' (run \code{\link{taichi_check_palette}()} with no arguments to see the
#' numbers) and is kept only for continuity. \code{palette} selects a
#' matched pair instead (\code{"balanced"} is the recommended one), and it
#' also accepts the output of \code{\link{taichi_palette_pair}()}. It sets
#' \code{yin_colors} and \code{yang_colors} together, so passing both is an
#' error, and as a ramp: a discrete fill samples it evenly, palest end
#' skipped, rather than taking its first colours.
#'
#' @section Interactivity:
#' Fill is the least accurate channel there is, which is why an interactive
#' version of a taichi grid is not a gimmick: hovering supplies the exact
#' values without giving up the encoding. With \code{interactive = TRUE} the
#' layers emit \pkg{ggiraph} grobs, and the plot becomes a widget when it is
#' passed to \code{ggiraph::girafe()}:
#'
#' \preformatted{  p <- ggplot(cafes_tg, aes(week, neighbourhood)) +
#'     geom_taichi(yin = matcha, yang = espresso, interactive = TRUE)
#'   ggiraph::girafe(ggobj = p)}
#'
#' The default tooltip carries both values, their difference, and the cell's
#' coordinates. \code{data_id_by} decides what a hover highlights:
#' \code{"cell"} (the default) lights up both fish of one glyph,
#' \code{"fish"} one fish at a time, and \code{"source"} every fish of one
#' source at once. That last one turns the superposition display into a
#' single-source display for as long as the pointer rests there, letting a
#' reader decompose the comparison instead of doing it in their head.
#' \code{tooltip}, \code{data_id} and \code{onclick} take a data column to
#' override any of it. The default ids name a cell by its \code{x} and
#' \code{y} values, so in a faceted plot the same cell lights up in every
#' panel at once. To keep the panels apart, give \code{data_id} an expression
#' that includes the facet variable, such as
#' \code{paste(state, week, category)}.
#'
#' The static rendering is unchanged: with \code{interactive = FALSE} the
#' package does not touch \pkg{ggiraph} at all, and with it \code{TRUE} the
#' same geometry is drawn, only in grobs that carry the extra attributes.
#' \pkg{plotly} is not and will not be supported: \code{ggplotly()} cannot
#' translate custom grobs, which is exactly what this package draws.
#'
#' @param yin The unquoted column name (or a literal string naming a column)
#'   for the yin (dark) fish of the taichi symbol. To pass a name held in a
#'   variable, use \code{.data[[nm]]} or \code{!!rlang::sym(nm)}; a bare
#'   variable would be mapped as a constant fill, exactly as it would be inside
#'   \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}()}.
#' @param yang The unquoted column name (or a literal string naming a column)
#'   for the yang (light) fish of the taichi symbol, as \code{yin}.
#' @param yin_name The label name (in quotes) for the legend of the yin
#'   rendering. Default is \code{NULL} (uses the column name). It titles a
#'   supplied \code{yin_scale} too, unless that scale object names itself.
#' @param yang_name The label name (in quotes) for the legend of the yang
#'   rendering. Default is \code{NULL} (uses the column name). It titles a
#'   supplied \code{yang_scale} too, unless that scale object names itself.
#' @param yin_colors A color vector, usually as hex codes, for the yin fish
#'   fill. Used as a gradient for continuous data and as a discrete palette
#'   for factor/character data. Ignored if \code{yin_scale} is provided.
#' @param yang_colors A color vector, usually as hex codes, for the yang fish
#'   fill. Used as a gradient for continuous data and as a discrete palette
#'   for factor/character data. Ignored if \code{yang_scale} is provided.
#' @param palette A matched pair of ramps to use instead of
#'   \code{yin_colors} / \code{yang_colors}: the name of a
#'   \code{\link{taichi_palette}()} preset (\code{"balanced"},
#'   \code{"diverging"}, \code{"viridis_pair"}, \code{"brewer_pair"},
#'   \code{"greyscale_safe"}, \code{"default"}) or a list with \code{yin} and
#'   \code{yang} colour vectors, such as the result of
#'   \code{\link{taichi_palette_pair}()}. Default \code{NULL}, which keeps the
#'   package's historical grey / seal-red pair. See the Palettes section.
#' @param yin_scale An optional fill scale for the yin fish: either a ready
#'   scale object or a scale constructor function (e.g.
#'   \code{ggplot2::scale_fill_viridis_d}). Overrides auto-detection. It must
#'   govern a \emph{fill} aesthetic; a scale for another aesthetic (say
#'   \code{scale_colour_viridis_c}) is rejected with an error rather than
#'   quietly leaving the fish on the default gradient.
#' @param yang_scale An optional fill scale for the yang fish, as
#'   \code{yin_scale}.
#' @param angle Rotation of each glyph in degrees, counter-clockwise: either a
#'   single number or an unquoted column name (one angle per cell). A mapped
#'   column must be numeric.
#' @param eyes Logical. If \code{TRUE}, draws the classic taichi eyes (dots),
#'   each centred in its fish's head. Default \code{FALSE}, preserving the
#'   plain v0.1.0 look.
#' @param yin_eye_size,yang_eye_size Size of each eye as a proportion of the
#'   glyph radius: a constant (default 0.15) or an unquoted data column to
#'   encode a variable (see the Eyes section for the rescaling rule).
#' @param yin_eye_colour,yang_eye_colour Colour of each eye dot: a constant,
#'   an unquoted data column containing colour strings, or \code{NULL} (the
#'   default) to take the colour from the theme: the yin eye from the
#'   theme's \code{paper} and the yang eye from its \code{ink}, which is white
#'   and black on every light theme and swaps on a dark one. On ggplot2 before
#'   4.0.0, where themes cannot set geom defaults, \code{NULL} falls back to
#'   the literal "white" and "black".
#' @param explicit Which relationship between the two sources to compute and
#'   show as a third channel: \code{"none"} (the default), \code{"difference"},
#'   \code{"ratio"}, \code{"log_ratio"} or \code{"z"}. See the Explicit
#'   encoding section, and \code{\link{taichi_summary}()} for the definitions.
#' @param explicit_channel Where the computed statistic goes:
#'   \code{"eye_size"} (the default), \code{"angle"}, \code{"border"} or
#'   \code{"radius"}. Ignored when \code{explicit = "none"}. The chosen
#'   channel cannot also be set by hand: \code{explicit_channel = "angle"}
#'   together with an \code{angle} argument, for example, is an error rather
#'   than a silent override.
#' @param explicit_range Two numbers giving the output range of
#'   \code{explicit_channel}, or \code{NULL} (the default) for that channel's
#'   own sensible range.
#' @param radius_exponent Only used by \code{explicit_channel = "radius"}: the
#'   exponent relating the statistic to the glyph radius. \code{0.5} is strict
#'   area scaling; the default \code{0.57} is the cartographic
#'   apparent-magnitude (Flannery) compensation, which makes larger symbols
#'   slightly larger than the geometry alone would give because readers
#'   systematically underestimate the area ratio between big and small
#'   circles.
#' @param interactive If \code{TRUE}, draw the fish (and their eyes) as
#'   \pkg{ggiraph} grobs carrying \code{tooltip}, \code{data_id} and
#'   \code{onclick}, so that \code{ggiraph::girafe()} turns the plot into a
#'   widget. Needs the \pkg{ggiraph} package. Default \code{FALSE}, which
#'   renders exactly as before and does not touch \pkg{ggiraph}. See the
#'   Interactivity section.
#' @param tooltip,data_id,onclick Optional unquoted data columns overriding
#'   the interactive attributes. Used only when \code{interactive = TRUE}; by
#'   default \code{tooltip} is built from the two values, their difference and
#'   the cell's coordinates, \code{data_id} from \code{data_id_by}, and
#'   \code{onclick} is empty.
#' @param data_id_by Scope of the default \code{data_id}, i.e. what one hover
#'   highlights: \code{"cell"} (both fish of that glyph; the default),
#'   \code{"fish"} (one fish), or \code{"source"} (every fish of that source,
#'   in every cell). Ignored when \code{data_id} is supplied.
#' @param shared_limits If \code{TRUE} and both sources are of the same type
#'   (both continuous, or both discrete), the two auto-built fill scales share
#'   common limits (the union range, or the union of levels, of \code{yin} and
#'   \code{yang}), so equal values read as equal ink. Explicit \code{limits}
#'   passed through \code{...} take precedence. As of 0.3.0 the shared limits
#'   are also pushed into a custom \code{yin_scale} / \code{yang_scale} that
#'   does not set limits of its own, so a supplied binned scale shares breaks
#'   too. Default \code{FALSE}.
#' @param shared_legend If \code{TRUE}, treats the two sources as directly
#'   comparable: implies \code{shared_limits = TRUE}, paints both fish with
#'   \code{yin_colors}, and shows a single legend (the yang guide is
#'   dropped). Unless \code{yin_name} is supplied, the legend is titled
#'   "\code{yin} / \code{yang}". Default \code{FALSE}. This is the
#'   perceptually correct choice whenever the two sources really are
#'   directly comparable: one ramp means equal values are equal ink by
#'   construction, with no palette pairing to get wrong (see the Palettes
#'   section). The cost is that the sources are then told apart only by their
#'   position inside the glyph: yin is the top bulb, yang the bottom. When
#'   a custom \code{yang_scale} is supplied it is used as given, so making the
#'   two palettes agree is then your business; the duplicate yang guide is
#'   dropped either way.
#' @param width,height Width and height of each cell. Typically omitted.
#' @param alpha Alpha transparency for the fish fills. A single value for the
#'   whole layer (see the Styling section).
#' @param na.rm If \code{TRUE}, silently removes rows with missing positions
#'   (a missing fill is drawn in the scale's \code{na.value}; see the Missing
#'   values section).
#' @param colour Outline colour of the fish. A single value for the whole
#'   layer (see the Styling section).
#' @param linewidth Outline width of the fish (in mm). Replaces the deprecated
#'   \code{size} aesthetic of ggtaichi 0.1.0. A single value for the whole
#'   layer (see the Styling section).
#' @param linetype Outline linetype of the fish. A single value for the whole
#'   layer (see the Styling section).
#' @param show.legend Logical. Should the layer be included in the legend?
#' @param key_glyph The legend key glyph, passed on to
#'   \code{\link[ggplot2]{layer}()}. Both fish default to a small taichi with
#'   their own half filled (see \code{\link{draw_key_taichi}()}), and the one
#'   legend \code{shared_legend} keeps fills both halves; pass \code{"rect"}
#'   for the plain ggplot2 rectangles of earlier versions. Keys only appear
#'   for discrete fills; a continuous fill gets a colourbar.
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to \emph{both} auto-built fill
#'   scales (e.g., shared \code{limits} or \code{na.value}). Because they go
#'   to both, an argument that suits only one kind of scale will be rejected by
#'   the other when \code{yin} and \code{yang} are of different types: a
#'   numeric \code{limits}, for instance, draws ggplot2's "Continuous limits
#'   supplied to discrete scale" warning from the discrete fish. For per-fish
#'   scale options, supply \code{yin_scale} / \code{yang_scale} instead. The
#'   scale arguments \code{geom_taichi()} fills in itself (\code{name},
#'   \code{values} and \code{colors} / \code{colours}) are not accepted
#'   here; use \code{yin_name} / \code{yang_name} and \code{yin_colors} /
#'   \code{yang_colors}.

  # `group` is deliberately left alone. Nothing in this geom reads it (draw
  # time batches every row of a panel into one polygon and numbers the
  # vertices itself), but gganimate *encodes the frame into `group`*, as a
  # "<id>" suffix, and anything that overwrites it collapses every transition
  # to a single frame. Versions before 0.3.0 reset it to seq_len(nrow(data))
  # whenever it held duplicates, which every transition produces, and that is
  # why no animation ever advanced.

#' The individual taichi fish layers
#'
#' `geom_yin_fish()` and `geom_yang_fish()` each draw one of the two
#' interlocking fish of a taichi symbol per `(x, y)` cell. They are the
#' building blocks that [geom_taichi()] assembles (together with two fill
#' scales and a [ggnewscale::new_scale_fill()] break); use them directly when
#' you want full control: to bring your own fill scale for a single fish, to
#' stack scales differently, or to draw only one source.
#'
#' Both geoms understand the aesthetics `x`, `y`, `fill`, `colour`,
#' `linewidth`, `linetype`, `alpha`, `width`, `height`, `angle` (degrees,
#' counter-clockwise), `radius` (a proportion of the cell's own radius, so
#' `0.5` draws a half-size glyph in the same cell), `border` (a per-cell
#' outline width in mm, overriding `linewidth`), `eye_size`, and
#' `eye_colour` (the latter two only matter when `eyes = TRUE`), plus
#' `tooltip`, `data_id` and `onclick`, which are only read when
#' `interactive = TRUE`. At `angle = 0` the yin fish is the left half of the
#' circle plus the top bulb (its head); the yang fish is the right half plus
#' the bottom bulb.
#'
#' @param mapping,data,stat,position,inherit.aes See [ggplot2::layer()].
#' @param width,height Cell size; defaults to the resolution of the data.
#' @param eyes Logical. Draw the classic eye dot inside this fish's head?
#' @param interactive Logical. Draw \pkg{ggiraph} grobs carrying the
#'   `tooltip`, `data_id` and `onclick` aesthetics, so that
#'   `ggiraph::girafe()` can turn the plot into a widget. Needs the
#'   \pkg{ggiraph} package.
#' @param na.rm If `TRUE`, silently removes rows with missing positions; a
#'   missing `fill` is drawn in the scale's `na.value` instead.
#' @param show.legend Logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
#' @param key_glyph Legend key glyph; defaults to this fish's half of a
#'   taichi symbol (see [draw_key_taichi()]). Passed to [ggplot2::layer()].
#' @param ... Other arguments passed to [ggplot2::layer()]: either aesthetics
#'   used as constant parameters (e.g. `eye_size = 0.2`) or geom parameters.
